# Who Am I, and What Is This?
I've had a bit of an odd run. Initially a music student, I became a composer for television and film while playing in bands. I tumbled backwards into a relatively successful rock band called SUUNS, with whom I recorded and toured for a decade. I returned to McGill to study experimental psychology and signal processing,  auditory perception and music cognition. Then I studied computer engineering. And now I am a PhD candidate in computer science.

In my professional life, I have had the good fortune of working with many talented and productive creatives. I have also worked as a research scientist and Product Owner in in-ear and medical communications.

I want to know how people make things, and what we can do to get the most out of people. I believe we all have the capacity to create, and most have a latent yearning to do so. In my research, I hope to make a bot that can unleash that potential.

This blog will be a space where I track my research journey. I hope to capture reflections on contemporary research, and off-the-cuff observations about the nature of creativity, humanity and computer assistance in the age of artificial intelligence. 

No matter what happens in the coming years, creativity is central to what makes us human--it is evergreen, hence my interest in computer assisted creativity. Until next time...
