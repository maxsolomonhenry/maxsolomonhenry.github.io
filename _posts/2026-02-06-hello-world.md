This is a sample blog post. Replace or delete this once you're ready to write your first real entry.

To create a new post, add a Markdown file to `_posts/` with the naming convention:

```
YYYY-MM-DD-title-of-post.md
```

Each post needs front matter at the top:

```yaml
---
layout: post
title: "Your Post Title"
---
```

Then write your content in Markdown below the front matter.
