# Cognitive Engineers
Just a half-thought today, perhaps not a unique one, that natural language processing being in the state that its in --- allowing objective, quantitative access to an embedding space of concepts --- positions HCI researchers as major beneficiaries, inheriting a treasure trove of what was once much less actionable research, that can be applied, through careful prompting and system design, with a far greater experimental control and signal to noise ratio. I am very grateful to have discovered the work of Prof Elana Glassman, for example.
